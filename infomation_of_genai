Generative AI creates new content, like text or images, based on patterns in data. Large Language Models (LLMs) are a powerful form of this AI, generating human-like text, while Small Language Models (SLMs) focus on specialized tasks with less data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances these models by pulling in external information for more accurate results. 

AI Agents use generative AI to autonomously perform tasks such as writing or research. Together, they represent cutting-edge advancements in automation and creativity.

we are seeing the chagnes in industires reatled work and decision took with help of Ai, AI is like make more abstraction layer not removing but add abstraction layer, and 



I am leaning Ai but what is possibilities of I know everythings and work according that, so make sure things only work on our decision and this should be like make your habit in good way, I am saying but ask the question and get the answer from devlopers becuase they know lots of things and now it's time to make things in that way which is requied, currently I have one project and that project require lots of in depth of knoledge of github integration and AI part so First I should fouce on make the application relted that and then and then I will understand what is most inpotent in life.
