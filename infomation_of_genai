Generative AI creates new content, like text or images, based on patterns in data. Large Language Models (LLMs) are a powerful form of this AI, generating human-like text, while Small Language Models (SLMs) focus on specialized tasks with less data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances these models by pulling in external information for more accurate results. 

AI Agents use generative AI to autonomously perform tasks such as writing or research. Together, they represent cutting-edge advancements in automation and creativity.
